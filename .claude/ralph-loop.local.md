Carefully read the migration guide at https://bevy.org/learn/migration-guides/0-17-to-0-18/ Make a branch bevy-0.17 if non-existent to keep the old version available. Make and checkout a temp branch for the work herein. Migrate the crate to Bevy 0.18 as version 0.3.0. Update docs and README. Report all API changes especially breaking ones. Make integration tests in the tests folder ensuring that everything works as intended. Clean up bevy lint, cargo check pedantic, and cargo test everything. Finally report all critical changes for review. After I gave permission, I want you to prepare the PR. --promise DONE
